## Introduction

In this Assignment you will Create an interactive web page that demonstrates JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic programming concepts learned in Chapter 3. so the image of the assignment [design file](/desktop/design.png)


## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up your git flow

Follow these steps to set up your project and start working on it:

- [ ] Fork this project.
- [ ] add Collaborator.
- [ ] Clone your forked version (Not KUProjects's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<YourFirstName-YourLastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<YourFirstName-YourLastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push -u origin `<YourFirstName-YourLastName>`.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

This assignment covers all the key concepts from Chapter 3 you learned to apply to the assignment, follow these steps to get the job done:

- [ ]  Make sure to write comments explaining your code.
- [ ]  Make sure to write a valid and readable code that can be run without any errors.
- [ ]  Create an HTML file named counter.html with:
- [ ]  A heading "Interactive Counter"
- [ ]  A paragraph displaying a counter value (start at 0)

        - Three buttons:

            - "Increment" - increases counter by 1

            - "Decrement" - decreases counter by 1

            - "Reset" - sets counter back to 0

       - A text input field where users can set a custom counter value

       - A button "Set Custom Value" that applies the input field's value to the counter

- [ ] Create a JavaScript file named script.js with:

        - Event listeners for all buttons

        - Functions to handle counter logic

        - DOM manipulation to update the displayed counter

        - Special behavior when counter reaches multiples of 10 (show an alert)

        - Input validation (ensure custom value is a number)

 - [ ]  Bonus Features (optional):

    - Add visual feedback when counter is positive/negative/zero (change color)

    - Implement auto-increment/decrement functionality using setInterval

    - Add animation effects when counter changes


- [ ] Submit a pull request to merge <YourfirstName-YourlastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
